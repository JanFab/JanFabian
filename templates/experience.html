                <p>
                    "Learning by doing" is one of the main methods in global Scout movement. Since 2014 I've learnt a lot about management, communication, leadership and many other soft skills.

                <p>
                    Until January 2023 I was a boy-scout troop leader. Main responsibility was long-term leadership of a scout troop (3. oddiel skautov Delfíny, 68. zbor Biele Vrany, Košice) with 40 members aged 11-20 years old. This includes long-term planning, event organization, mentoring, youth and self education.
